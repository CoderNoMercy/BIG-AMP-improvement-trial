# BIG-AMP-improvement-trial
This is a project I did from July,2018 to June,2019, which aims to use variational bayesian method to improve the traditional 
BiG-AMP algorithm. It is a trial on that thought. It improves the result in some cases, but results in unstablity compared to traditional one.
I move this code online for your reference if you are also interested in this topic.
